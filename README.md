# NYC Citibike Analysis
## Overview of the statistical analysis
**Explain the purpose of the new analysis.**

We will analyse the Citi Bike data for the month of August, 2019 to visualize the results of the data and the people's behavior to show the length of time and the number of bike trips by gender.

## Results
**Using the visualizations you have in your Tab describe the results of each visualization underneeath the image.**

As we can see from the grph above the highet checkout time is within 20 minutes. This determines that people using the bikes for 20 minutes once they use it.

[Checkout Times by Gender](https://public.tableau.com/authoring/NYCCitibikeAnalysis_16375493949790/CheckoutTimesbyGender#1)

We can conclude that all genders use the bikes the same time length, howver the male gender have the highest number of using the bikes.

[Trips by Weekday per Hour](https://public.tableau.com/authoring/NYCCitibikeAnalysis_16375493949790/TripsbyWeekdayperHour#1)

During the weekdays the trips taken by the people are the most around 8am-9am and 5pm-6pm. This behavior is becasuse of the "rush hours" where people after using the trains to get to NYC they find it more convinient to use the bikes to move around NYC. However, the number of trips during the weekend is distributed almost equivalent during the day after 11am.

Even from this graph we can determine that the gender male as same behavior as we concluded in the analysis above. Whereas the female and the unknown gender have less peak behaivor on the trips taken.

The male subscibers are have the highest trips on Thursday/Friday and the lowest on Sunday. The female subsribers have a almost same trips during the days of the week and the differnce of this trips are arounf 10,000 trips. The unknown gender have the most trips on the weekend and they are just random customers.

On the story I will add the August peak hours and the gender breakdown.

![Chart](https://github.com/roxhensa02/NYC-Citibikes-Analysis/blob/main/Images/August%20Peak%20Hours.png)

Using this graph, we can see clearly the peak hours on the bike usage. This will give a clear visualization on the which time the bikes are used the most.

[Gender Breakdown](https://public.tableau.com/authoring/NYCCitibikeAnalysis_16375493949790/GenderBreakdown#1)

![Chart](https://github.com/roxhensa02/NYC-Citibikes-Analysis/blob/main/Images/Gender%20Breakdown.png)

Since most of our analysis is based on gender, it is a good idea to see the gender breakdown and which gender is using the bikes the most. As we can see the male gender is using the bikes at a higher number, followed by the female gender and then the unknown gender.
